/*
 * This source implements memory manager classes that offer very fast, lightweight, realtime and
 * thread-safe allocation and deallocation of arbitrary class instances. Using this approach, instances
 * are preallocated and postdeleted and stored in lock-free real-time data structures.
 *
 * This allows real-time and time critical threads to get new instances on demand, and to free them without
 * pausing. The actual memory allocation and deletion are managed in a manager thread.
