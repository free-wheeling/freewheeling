### Free and Open Source Audio Tool for Live Looping

Freewheeling provides a highly configurable, intuitive, and fluid user
interface for instrumentalists to capture audio loops in real-time. Best
way to understand Freewheeling?? [See and hear it][Freewheeling_Screenshots] in action.
[Demo Video][Freewheeling_Demo_Video].


### Philosophy

```
Freewheeling is
a new way 'to be'
In The Muse-ical Moment.
It's a live looping instrument
that returns us to the joy
of making music 'spontaneously'.
```

Freewheeling allows us to build repetitive grooves by sampling and
directing loops from within spirited improvisation. It works because,
down to the core, it's built around improv. We leave mice and menus, and
dive into our own process of making sound. The principle author of
Freewheeling is JP Mercury. Freewheeling was also originally a Max/MSP
external. Since 2016, it is maintained by the user community.


### Technical Details

Freewheeling runs under GNU/Linux (PC/Mac) and Mac OS X (PPC/Intel)
using the [Jack Audio Connection Kit][JACK] sound server, and
is Free and Open Source Software, released under the GNU GPL license.
The ChangeLog is a good resource, because all major new features have
been documented there. It is humble enough to run on modest hardware but
can take advantage of the gobs of RAM on modern machines as well. The
only limits are your imagination.

**Focus on the ideation process:**

-   Freewheeling empowers the trance of immediate creativity by bringing
    us into a circular process. Time is utterly relative, and we are
    freed from the future-oriented mindset of product sequencing. If
    inspiration flows, later arranging and editing on a timeline can be
    done with other tools.

See the [Technical Features][Technical_Features].

NOTE: You will also need the JACK audio server and a way to configure it
(such as qJackCtl or Cadence). A very easy way to setup a GNU/Linux audio workstation
is by installing the [KxStudio Operating System][KxStudio_Downloads].

NOTE: Debian (and derrivatives such as Trisquel, Ubuntu, and Mint) can transform
their system into KxStudio simply by adding the [KxStudio repos][KxStudio_Repos]
and installing the 'kxstudio-meta-all' package (or 'kxstudio-meta-audio' for just the
pro-audio programs). It is highly recommended that you install at least
the 'kxstudio-default-settings' package which optimizes your system
performance for real-time audio use.

NOTE: ArchLinux (and derrivatives such as Parabola, Hyperbola, and Manjaro)
can simply install the 'pro-audio' package group, which includes Freewheeling.
It is highly recommended that you install at least the 'realtime-privileges' package
which configures your system for real-time audio use.
