NEW in V0.5.3- Combination Zone Patches
---------------------------------------

	    * More flexible MIDI patch routing. 

	      - Combination patches allow you to split one MIDI controller
	        into a range of zones. This allows you to control several
	        different sounds or softsynths from one MIDI control source.
		
		A patch defines the zones, as well as the output port and
		channel that each zone sends to. You can also send
	        MIDI program and bank change messages for each zone, allowing
		you to switch programs on external synths. 

		All of this functionality is integrated into the patch browser,
		so you can seamlessly control other synth apps and 
		sound modules from within FreeWheeling. 
		
		See 'examples/combipatchdemo.xml' for an example 
		configuration.

Patch Browser Definition Example
--------------------------------

The file patches1.xml contains an example for how to define patches for an external soft synth.
In this case it's an example for a Ghostess DSSI host running one instance of WhySynth and
one instance of Hexter.

To use this example, copy 'examples/patches1.xml' to the ~/.fweelin/ folder
(this folder is created by version 0.5.2 and forward).

The WhySynth instance is on channel 0 (first channel),
and the Hexter instance is on channel 1 (second channel).

When you specify this patch list in Freewheeling's .fweelin.rc configuration file:

    <patchbank midiport="2" patches="patches1.xml"/>
    
you will then be able to play both your WhySynth and your Hexter patches, and
switch between them.

The WhySynth and Hexter patches will appear in separate sections of the patch browser.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can automatically generate a patch list from a set of DSSI plugin patches.
This saves the work of manually entering all of your patch information.

To do this, apply the included patch to Ghostess (scripts/patch-ghostess-xml-patchlist).
The patch modifies Ghostess so that when you select 'Save Configuration...' from the
File menu, you get both a script to startup Ghostess with the current config and patchset,
-as well as- an .XML file with the same base name, that contains the patch list for Freewheeling.

I've submitted this patch to Sean Bolton for inclusion in an upcoming Ghostess release.
Please nudge him if it has been useful for you (http://home.jps.net/~musound/).
