# Aid for trimming loop/scene libraries
#
# This script can be used in the FreeWheeling library folder (fw-lib/ by default)
# to delete all loops & scenes with a specific date-
#
# For example: godelete-date "Apr 15" deletes all files from April 15. Don't forget quotes!
#              godelete-date "Apr 16 21:" deletes all files from April 16 from 9pm-10pm. 
#
# No files are deleted before prompting you
#
echo Found these files..
ls -lt | grep "$1"
rm -i `ls -lt | grep "$1" | awk '{ print $9 }'`
