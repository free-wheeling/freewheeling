# Aid for managing loop/scene libraries
#
# This script can be used in the FreeWheeling library folder (fw-lib/ by default)
# to move all loops & scenes with a specific date-
#
# For example: gomv-date "Apr 15" test/ moves all files from April 15 to folder 'test'. Don't forget quotes!
#              gomv-date "Apr 16 21:" old/ moves all files from April 16 from 9pm-10pm to folder 'old'. 
#
# No files are moved before prompting you.
#
echo Found these files..
ls -lt | grep "$1"
echo "Move these files to $2? (Enter=Yes, CTRL-C=Abort)"
read
mv -i -v `ls -lt | grep "$1" | awk '{ print $9 }'` $2
