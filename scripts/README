Managing A Library Of Loops & Scenes
------------------------------------

** godelete-date, gomv-date, goarchive-date scripts
   
   Delete/Move, and Archive loops & scenes by date.
   See individual files for instructions.

** goarchive-scene script
   
   Archive a scene and all the loops it uses.

Connecting FreeWheeling with Other Linux Audio apps
---------------------------------------------------

-Hexter
-Jack-Rack

Example Scripts and Presets:
---------------------------

Several Jack-Racks that use tube amp sims and reverb, and some scripts to load FreeWheeling and Hexter, a killer
DX7 synth emulator. 

-
Running 'gofweel' will load FreeWheeling and hook it up to reverb and tube amp. Your live mix will still be
saved to disk dry, so you can tweak the FX later.

-
Running 'godx7' will load Hexter DX7 emulator and connect to tube amp. If FreeWheeling is running, DX7 becomes
an input into FreeWheeling (channel 2). If not, DX7 is loaded standalone.

-
Running 'gofweel-dx7' will load FreeWheeling and DX7 as above, and connect them. You get the DX7 synth connected
through a light phaser, then into FreeWheeling. FreeWheeling is channeled through valve saturation and tube amp
plugins, and a wide open reverb. This is the whole enchilada.

***
You will have to tweak the scripts to change your MIDI hardware name- see script 'waitalsaports'.
***

***
You will also have to patch Jack-Rack (see included patch-) to load a .rack at startup. 
This is a feature that the author, I think, intends to implement, but I have done it for him.
The scripts use this feature to autoload a rack.
For more info, type 'jack-rack -?' after patching and recompiling and look at the -f option. 
***

*** Note these scripts are rather aggressive at killing tasks. If you have running versions of
    freewheeling, ghostess, jack-dssi-host, or jack-rack, expect them to suddenly stop! **

*** I recommend ghostess for hosting your DSSI synths- it allows you to save patch banks for auto startup.

Good Luck!
