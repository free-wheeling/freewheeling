<!-- Welcome to FreeWheeling's configuration system.

     If you know XML, no problem.
     There's definitely a learning curve here,
     but what you get is great flexibility.

     Here, you can set up FreeWheeling to look and feel 
     the way that is most intuitive for you. 

     FreeWheeling is especially configurable where it comes to
     different input controllers, such as QWERTY and piano keyboards,
     MIDI control boxes, footswitches and pedalboards, etc. 

     In the graphics section, you can define a graphical layout so that your 
     control surfaces will appear onscreen as they do at your feet or 
     fingertips. This is important, because you will be grabbing and 
     controlling loops from different MIDI/keyboard controllers.

     In the events section, you can tell FreeWheeling how you want it to
     respond to the physical buttons and switches you press,
     sliders you move, and movements you make. Most of FreeWheeling's 
     important functions can be controlled from any input. 

     Underlying the configuration system is a robust language. 
     You can do things like map velocity of a MIDI note to a 
     certain parameter in FreeWheeling; Scale, map and transform MIDI
     events; Create your own toggles and modes; And trigger several events
     from one input. If you can learn how to configure FreeWheeling,
     then you will have a robust performance controller at your fingertips.

     Happy FreeWheeeling! 
     Your feedback is appreciated.
