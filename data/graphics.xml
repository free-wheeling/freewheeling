<!-- Here in this graphics section, we define the way FreeWheeling looks onscreen.
     The aim is to create a visual layout that is simple and functional.
     
     So, key areas are highly configurable. For example, FreeWheeling is
     designed to show you where your loops are mapped. One user may be a 
     drummer with a MIDI kit and footswitches, where another might be sitting
     at the keyboard of a laptop. The graphics section for each of these users
     can be configured with the geometry of the places where loops go. We 
     can say how our laptop keyboard looks, so that the loops will appear
     onscreen inside pictures of the keys to which they are assigned. Or we 
     could configure visuals for our drumkit layout.

     The section is divided into a number of layouts. Each layout is a
     collection of elements. Each element is a collection of geometries that
     tell FreeWheeling how to draw that element. For example, a MIDI piano
     keyboard is composed of all the white and black notes. Each note is
     made up of rectangles. 
   
     Elements also specify where loops should be drawn, and at what size.
     For the E key on the PC keyboard, we can specify where the loop will
     show and at what size. For a footswitch, we can do the same.

     Layouts do not define how loops are captured and triggered- only
     how they look onscreen. -->

<!-- Screen resolution. This must be set first! -->
  <var resolution="640,480"/>

<!-- Video update delay (ms). Delay for this many milliseconds between
     video draws. On a slow system you will want a higher number to conserve
     CPU. -->
  <var videodelay="40"/>

<!-- Fonts to load -

     name="main" is the main font for most onscreen text displays
     name="help" is the font for help panel
     name="small" is the font for indicators and toggles
     name="tiny" is the font for synthedit and looptray

     FreeWheeling includes Bitstream Vera fonts by default.
     Any custom font files specified below should be relative to /usr/share/fonts/ -->

  <font name="main"  file="truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/VeraBd.ttf" size="20" />
  <font name="help"  file="truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/Vera.ttf"   size="16" />
  <font name="small" file="truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/VeraBd.ttf" size="14" />
  <font name="tiny"  file="truetype/ttf-bitstream-vera/Vera.ttf"   size="10" />

<!-- All positions on screen follow a coordinate system with (0,0) at the 
     top left and (1,1) at the bottom right of the screen.
    
     So if the screen resolution changes, no problem. -->

<!-- Here are some examples:

     <layout id="0" name="PC Keyboard" scale="1.0,1.0" pos="0.00,0.00"
      label="0" elabel="1" show="1">

     This defines a visual layout "PC Keyboard":
     
     The ID is used later in the event bindings to refer to a layout. 
     The name will show up onscreen if label="1" is set. 

     Scale specifies scaling for the whole layout. It is
     an easy way to make the whole layout bigger or smaller. 

     Pos specifies the top left position for the whole layout- an easy way 
     to move the whole layout onscreen. 

     If elabel="1" is set, the elements will have their names showing. 

     If show="0", this layout will remain hidden until an 
     video-show-layout event is received.

       <element id="113" name="Q" base="0.0,0.0" looppos="0.05,0.05" 
        loopsize="0.1" namepos="0.01,0.00">

     Inside this layout, we have defined one element named "Q".
     This is the Q key on the PC keyboard. It is not associated with the
     keypress of Q, but only the way the Q key looks.

     ID is the identifier for the element within the layout. It is 
     important to choose IDs carefully, because visual layouts will
     be matched with loopids based on this ID. For example, an event binding
     (specified later) assigns loops to keys pressed on the keyboard. 
     The loopid is assigned based on the keysym (key symbol) for the key 
     pressed, so that when Q is pressed, the loop is stored in loopid 113. 
     Then, the visuals will correctly draw the loop in id 113.

     Base specifies the base location of the element in the layout.
     All coordinates for loop and name position, as well as the geometries
     of the element, are relative to this base.

     The name of the element is shown at namepos (relative to the base),
     if elabel="1" is set in the layout.

     An animated graphical loop scope is shown at looppos and
     loopsize. The loop shown is stored at baseloopid + element ID.
     Baseloopid is set with the video-show-loop event, which allows
     a layout to show a range of loop ids.

          <box outline="TBLR" pos="0.00,0.00, 0.10,0.10"/>
       </element> 

     In each element, we have a number of geometries. Right now there is only
     one type of geometry and that is box. An element is made of boxes.
     Each box has position left,top,right,bottom given in pos. The box
     is outlined as given in outline (letters T B L and R for top, bottom,
     left and right).
