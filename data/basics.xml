<!-- In FreeWheeling, the storage of loops is independent from 
     the user interface that was used to capture them. This is important, 
     because it opens up doors for collaboration: loops captured by a PC 
     keyboard can be triggered by a footswitch. In future, perhaps loops will
     be downloaded from the Net as part of collaborative improvisation rooms.
     These will then be available on any user interface.

     This parameter establishes the number of loop ids or places to put loops.
     FreeWheeling starts with a map of empty placeholders.
     As the user captures loops, they are assigned to different
     places in this map. Different user interfaces, such as keyboard keys,
     drum triggers, footpedals, switches, or piano keys- can refer to
     different loopids for capturing and triggering loops. And visually, 
     you can define different onscreen layouts to show loops.

     This variable determines the total number of loopids.
     Note that even a very large map is memory efficient, because space for 
     a loop sample is not allocated until that loop is recorded. -->
  <var numloopids="1024"/>

<!-- A user can grab snapshots, which store all settings for playing loops
     and levels. This allows 'song sections' to be easily created and 
     switched, all live. Here is the maximum number of snapshots that can
     be loaded. -->
  <var maxsnapshots="100"/>

<!-- Path to FreeWheeling library. The library stores loops, scenes and
     other data that persists between FreeWheeling sessions. -->
  <var librarypath="fw-lib/"/>

<!-- Number of MIDI output ports. 
     You can echo MIDI events to different MIDI out ports, and direct 
     specific MIDI events to specific ports. This allows you to connect 
     FreeWheeling to different soft-synths and FX and control them through
     separate MIDI ports. -->
  <var midiouts="4"/>

<!-- List of MIDI ports to send MIDI sync (MIDI clock) to.
     When enabled, Freewheeling will send timing sync info to these
     MIDI ports. This is a comma-separated list of those ports. 
     1 is the first MIDI port. -->
  <var midisyncouts="1"/> <!-- Send MIDI sync to first port only -->

<!-- External audio inputs to create into FreeWheeling.
     For each input, you have to specify- do I want a mono or stereo input?
     Each audio input in the string is one letter- M for mono or S for stereo.
     A stereo input creates two ports- input2L and input2R, for example.
     If you create any stereo ports, or if FluidSynth is set to run in
     stereo, FreeWheeling runs in stereo, which means larger buffers
     and more memory usage.

     You can capture loops from different combinations of inputs, and you
     can control their levels. FreeWheeling may add its own internal audio
     inputs- for example, from its integrated softsynth. 
     You don't need to account for those here. -->

<!-- Create inputs- one input per letter- M is mono and S is stereo! -->
  <var externalaudioinputs="MMS"/>

<!-- Limit the maximum play amplification to protect your sound system-
     this prevents us from accidentally ramping up the volume of a loop
     to ridiculous levels. 1.0 is 100% (0 dB) volume. -->
  <var maxplayvol="5.0"/>

<!-- Maximum gain for limiter. When this is above 1.0 (100% amplitude), the
     limiter acts like a high-ratio compressor, rising in gain until it reaches 
     this max. -->
  <var maxlimitergain="1.0"/>

<!-- Threshhold for limiter. When audio out goes above this threshold (1.0 is
     100% amplitude or 0 db), the limiter kicks in. 
     Since the limiter does not look ahead, it is a good idea to set the 
     threshhold slightly below max to avoid clipping. -->
  <var limiterthreshhold="0.75"/>

<!-- Limiter release rate. A higher number is a faster release. -->
  <var limiterreleaserate="0.000020"/>

<!-- dB at maximum throw for audio faders- how loud can you fade in dB? for example +6 dB -->
  <var fadermaxdb="6"/>

<!-- Fraction of total throw of fader where the 0 dB sits. for example 0.8 or 80% -->
  <var faderzeropoint="0.80"/>

<!-- File formats for saving loops and streaming audio. 

     Choose from the following options:

     OGG
     WAV
     AU
     FLAC

     -->
  <var loopoutformat="OGG"/>
  <var streamoutformat="OGG"/>

<!-- Quality setting for OGG encoding -->
  <var oggquality="0.5"/>

<!-- FreeWheeling compiles with FluidSynth, a SoundFont-based 
     soft synthesizer (Linux only, as of v0.5.3) -->

<!-- Run FluidSynth in stereo? This increases the size of audio memory. -->
  <fluidsynth stereo="1"/>

<!-- Parameters for FluidSynth integrated softsynth.

  <fluidsynth param="synth.polyphony" setint="64"/>
 
<!-- Interpolation setting for FluidSynth- lower setting, lower quality, 
     faster. FluidSynth default is 4. -->
  <fluidsynth interpolation="1"/>

<!-- MIDI channel for integrated FluidSynth. When the FluidSynth patchbank
     is selected, all unused MIDI events are folded into this channel 
     and fired to FluidSynth. So, currently, the integrated FluidSynth behaves
     as a single channel synth. -->
  <fluidsynth channel="0"/>
