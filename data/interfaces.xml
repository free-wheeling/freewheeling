  <!-- Interfaces to load. Each interface defines visuals and behavior 
for
       how Freewheeling responds to different hardware controllers. -->

  <!-- Each interface is automatically assigned an ID when loaded.

       An interface can contain displays (such as meters)
       and layouts (visual mappings of loops), as well as bindings
       that define how Freewheeling responds to different 
       buttons/sliders/keys/etc.

       Interfaces defined as 'switchable=0' have displays and layouts
       that are always visible- never switched. For example, the
       MIDI footswitch interface is always visible at the bottom right
       of Freewheeling's window for quick capturing of loops. -->
