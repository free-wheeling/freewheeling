Mr Thraz & Folks,

I've been remiss about not yet distributing my BCF-2000 setup for Freewheeling. But I'd like to give you guys somewhere to start configuring.

So I've attached my current BCF-2000 preset for Freewheeling. Send it to your BCF-2000 with 'aplaymidi' or similar. 

Instructions for Use:

Top row of 8 buttons: capture/play loops
Bottom row of 8 buttons:
 1- Shift (hold)
    Hold shift & press top 8 buttons to erase loops
 2- Undo (erase last loop)
 3- Previous page of 8 loops  (or snapshots in snap mode)
 4- Next page of 8 loops (or snapshots in snap mode)
 5- Deselect all looops
 6- Select playing loops
 7- Toggle selected loops
 8- Create pulse (press this after recording your first loop to lock other loops to it)

Faders:

1-4 are input levels
5 is master input level
6 is master output level
7 is feedback
8 is a quick patch change slider (patches are not actually changed until you press a button- see below)

Group 1 Knobs: Press 1-8 to toggle overdub for loops, Turn 1-8 to adjust loop levels
Group 2 Knobs: Press 1-8 to select loops, Turn to adjust relative level of ALL selected loops
Group 3 Knobs: Turn & Press Knob 8 to browse through and load scenes. 
   Press Knob 7 to save a scene of all loops.

4 Buttons on bottom right of BCF:

Top Left: Fader mode- switches BCF faders to toggle loop levels
Top Right: Unused
Bottom Left: Patch Change button (activate the MIDI patch you've browsed to).
Bottom Right: Toggle Snap mode 
(In snap mode: Shows snapshots. 
Select snapshots with loop buttons 1-8 (top row of 8 buttons). 
Page through snapshots with buttons 3 and 4 on the bottom row of 8 buttons.)

That's all for now. I hope this helps.
