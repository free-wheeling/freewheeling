Some Suggestions for Tuning Freewheeling's Audio Performance:

Run hdparm to set DMA & well behaved disk IO. Try:
hdparm -c3 -d1 -m16 -A1 -u1 /dev/hda (do for /dev/hdb .. also)

If you have a PCI audio interface, run setpci to set PCI latency. 
First, run 'lspci -v' and find the address of your audio board. Then run:
setpci -s 00:07.5 latency_timer=F8
(if your audio is at 00:07.5)

Set video depth to 8 or 16 bits. 24 and 32 bits are generally much slower.

Use fluxbox, blackbox, or another lightweight window manager on slower
machines.

Use lower sampling rates to achieve lower latency. Try 64 samples, 32000 Hz,
3 periods per buffer. This works well on several low end audio boards such as
ESS Maestro and AC 97. 

Lower latency is key for live looping! Otherwise, the latency will lag your
timing and it will feel very awkward.
