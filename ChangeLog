2019-05-02 v0.6.6
            * fixed thread-count race condition during memory-manager init -
              long-standing bug which caused intermittent startup failures
            * changed C FALSE to C++ false in fluidsynth class -
              fixes build failures with GCC9 on some systems


2019-01-29 v0.6.5
            * made compatible with both fluidsynth v1 and v2
            * fixed deprecation and compiler warnings and other housekeeping tasks
            * removed experimental 'elastin' classes


2017-04-03 v0.6.4

            * implemented 'tiny' font specified in graphics.xml (although still unused)


2017-04-01 v0.6.2

            * FreeWheeling now requires nettle instead of gnutls-openssl
              because gnutls-openssl is no longer supported on ArchLinux

2016-10-31 v0.6.1

            * new version control and repos - SVN history converted to git
              sadly, JP has been incommunicado for some time
              so it is not possible to properly maintain the sourceforge repo.
              the project has been forked to github and notabug for further development
              https://github.com/free-wheeling/freewheeling/
              https://notabug.org/freewheeling/freewheeling/

            * restored freewheeling wiki on github
              https://github.com/free-wheeling/freewheeling/wiki

            * upgraded autotools files

            * FreeWheeling will use semantic versioning from this point on (e.g. MAJOR.MINOR.REV)


IN PROGRESS v0.6.1 - SVN

            * Multi-track streaming. 

              Now you can stream each input to disk,
              stream loops to disk,
              and stream the whole final
              mix to disk. Control what to stream from basics.xml:

              This allows you to do more precise edits after a performance.
              It is especially useful for live microphone pickups, which
              often require separate gain and FX adjustments during later
              editing.

              <var streaminputs="NYYN"/>
              <var streamfinalmix="N"/>
              <var streamloopmix="Y"/>

              As always, the disk streams can be toggled in real-time with the
              PrintScreen key (see help). Freewheeling finds an unused
              filename for each new stream. The streams are time-aligned,
              so they can be loaded as tracks into a multi-track sequencer.

            Thursday March 10, 2011

            * Configurable soft monitoring is now available in basics.xml:

            <var audioinputmonitoring="YYNN"/>

            * QTractor OSC integration is now working.

            Saturday February 26, 2011

            After more than two years, activity has resumed on Freewheeling's
            development. I am in the process of refactoring the code to make 
            it more stable.

            New Features in the works:

            * DONE - Direct hardware mixing controls
 
              Direct control of ALSA mixer controls from within Freewheeling

            * DONE - SYNTHEDIT - An easier way to manage synth plugins with
              
              MANY parameters from a tactile interface with
              FEW knobs - stores parameters and allows motor-fader
              updates

            * FIXED - MIDI Sync Transmit now works as advertised -
    
              Loops stay in lockstep with externals
              Added MIDI sync metronome for listening to beats/bars.

            * QTractor integration. 

              Rui Nuno Capela and I are working on a QTractor branch that
              will allow snapshots of all playing loops to be instantly
              transferred into a QTractor session. Go from circular time
              to sequencer time! This SVN update contains proof-of-concept
              code against the 'qtractor-osc' branch.

              See data/bcf2000-help.txt for instructions if you use a 
              BCF-2000.

            * Snapshot moving
            
              ALT-P swaps the last two selected snapshots.
            
            * Z/X paging through loops now works across interfaces (BCF-2000, MIDI keyboard, ...)

            * As part of ongoing work to make Freewheeling more reliable,
              crash reports are now automatically generated if GDB is installed. 
              The type of crash is printed on the terminal. The report is saved to file 'fweelin-stackdump'.
              
              If you encounter a crash, please send me this file along with a description of what you were doing
              when the crash occurred. Thank you.

            * Fixed an overdub crash with the new triggering method
            * Fixed a positioning bug when recording loops with the new triggering method

            Friday December 25th, 2008
                        
            New Features
            ------------

            * This version uses an experimental new way of triggering loops. The loops always play immediately when triggered,
              and they start in the right place. 
              
              The 'right place' is given by a 'long count', which is the overall pattern
              of all loops. This method allows switching between snapshots mid-phrase 
              without a loss of positioning, and triggering new snapshots before the downbeat to catch pickup notes. 
              
              Musically, the long count is the length of the larger musical phrase which is described by all the loops.
              Mathematically, the long count's length is the LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) of the length of all loops that have been 
              activated. 
              
              (Example) For a scene with loops with length 1, 2, 4, and 8 beats, the long count is 8 beats. 
              For a scene with loops length 4 and 3 beats, the long count is 12 beats.
              
              You don't really have to think about the long count. 
              But it's helpful to know that the long count is defined so that when it rolls over, 
              all loops are rolling over to their start points.
              You can see the long count visually in an outer ring of the pulse display (top right).
                            
              The old triggering method is no longer in this version. I would appreciate any feedback you might have on how this
              new method works for you.
              
              Happy Holidays!

            New Features
            ------------

            * Automatic bypassing of unused channels now works with combi patches across many zones
            
            Sunday October 19th, 2008
            
            New Features
            ------------

            * Improved MIDI handling with automatic bypassing of unused channels

              This new feature keeps track of which patches are active and recently used, and which have sustaining notes either with
              or without pedal. FreeWheeling will automatically send out a configurable MIDI CC on those channels that are inactive,
              and another CC when those channels become active. As I'm playing, FreeWheeling automatically frees up CPU from
              unused plugin channels on my plugin hardware rack.
              
              You can use this feature with any plugin host that will bypass/unbypass channels via MIDI CC. I use it with a 
              Muse Research Receptor.

              ** Patch changes are now registered when you SELECT a patch. Browsing to the patch does not switch patches.
              Now, you must move to the new patch and press ENTER or a MIDI select button.

              For example, the following in a patch definition file:
              
              <patch bypasstime1="60" bypasstime2="5" channel="0" name="Piano"/>
              
              Defines a piano patch sending on channel 0 (1st MIDI channel). After 60 seconds of unreleased sustained notes, 
              when the channel is inactive, it will be bypassed. 5 seconds after all notes are released with the sustain pedal up,
              and once the channel is inactive, it will be bypassed. This follows the natural decay of a piano- long sustain, short
              release. I can play piano notes, hold them, and switch to another channel. When I release those piano notes, the appropriate
              notes are released and the channel is bypassed soon after. I am already continuing on with whatever new patch I'm playing.
              
              <patch bypasschannel="5" channel="10" name="D: Toms"/>
              <patch bypasschannel="5" channel="11" name="D: Snare"/>

              Here, two drum patches that receive on channel 10 and 11 are defined. They are both bypassed via channel 5. 
              I use this with multitimbral plugins that receive on several channels but are bypassed as one.
              
              To enable auto-bypass, you must define a MIDI CC to use. This can be defined for each patch or combi zone, but is
              more easily defined for a whole patchbank (from browsers.xml):
              
              <patchbank bypasscc="116" midiport="1" separatechannels="0" suppressprogramchanges="1" patches="patches-receptor-1.xml"/>

              Here MIDI CC #116 is used to auto-bypass channels on the Receptor.
              You can also set default values for bypasstime1 and bypasstime2 on a per-patchbank basis.

RELEASE     v0.6

            Friday October 3rd, 2008
            
            Folks,
            
            Here is a full 0.6 release. 
            Included are updated Mac and Linux versions. 
            The new Mac version works with the latest Jack 
            version and under OS X Leopard. 
            
            As you can see from the SVN updates below, 
            there's quite a bit that's new since 0.5.5.
            
            Your feedback is always welcome.

            v0.5.6 - SVN

            Thursday September 4th, 2008
            
            New Features
            ------------

            * Logarithmic faders and loop levels, conforming to IEC 60-268-18.
            
              Level meters and loop faders are now logarithmic, visually graded with 6dB markings.
              This means you can create much smoother fades using MIDI controllers,
              and you can see a broader range of levels on-screen.
              
              One new configuration parameter controls the maximum dB selectable:
              
              <!-- dB at maximum throw for audio faders- how loud can you fade in dB? for example +6 dB -->
              <var fadermaxdb="6"/>

            * Saving over existing snapshots now preserves name

            * Upgrades to BCF-2000 template
            
            Wednesday August 13th, 2008
            
            New Features
            ------------
            
            * Rename snapshots
              
              Press ALT-1 through ALT-9 to rename a snapshot.
              Label your song sections for easy recall.
              
            * Way overhauled BCF-2000 interface
            
              The Behringer BCF-2000 MIDI template has been overhauled. 
              Most major functions can be controlled from the surface.
              Continuously variable loop volumes, overdubs on knob presses,
              loop selection and triggering, scenes, pulses, and multiple
              pages of loops. The whole template can be customized by editing
              the MIDI CC variables at the top of the file.
              
              By changing the CCs, you can use it as a template for other control
              surfaces. A future configuration editor may build on this concept
              of 'templates with editable settings'. For now, 
              you can edit the file and adjust the most common commands easily.

            New Features
            ------------

            * Multiple pages of snapshots
              
              100 snapshots are provided by default (edit this in
              basics.xml). You can pageup/pagedown through them by holding
              CTRL or SHIFT and pressing , or .

              Then use CTRL 1-9 to trigger and SHIFT 1-9 to store.

            Fixes

            * Reworked some of the guts to fix crashes. Race condition 
              fixes in block manager.

              Thanks to Florent and Andrea for your crash reports. 
              They helped nail the bug.
        
            Monday Jun 16th, 2008

            New Features
            ------------

            * Create snapshots for playing loops
         
              - Create / save / load snapshots. All loop levels and playing
                loops are remembered.
              
                To create a snapshot, hold SHIFT and press 1-9.
                The snapshot is shown in a popup window.
        
              - An easy way to switch between song sections.

                To switch snapshots, hold CTRL and press 1-9.
                
              - Snapshots are saved/loaded in scenes. 

              Still to do on snapshots: Renaming, fading, 
              paging through snapshots on display, more flexible 
              synchronization.
        
            * Easily adjust levels for all selected loops

              To use: Select some loops. Hold CTRL and press UP/DOWN repeatedly
              to adjust all loop levels. Or, hold CTRL and use the mousewheel
              on any loop. All selected loops are adjusted.

              This works well when you have many loops that are overdriving
              Freewheeling's outputs. The limiter is bouncing around. You could
              reduce the output level, but this approach is more flexible- and 
              the results are saved in snapshots and scenes.

            New Features
            ------------

            * Completely revamped configuration system-

              Better splitting and organization-
                There are now many configuration files.
              The configuration is divided into 'interfaces'.
              Each interface defines behavior and display related to
                a hardware interface. 
              You can build whole functionality for a given MIDI interface
                such as a fader box, and share it on the Internet.
              This should help the current situation where people are 
              patching together bits of each other's configurations.

            * Adjustable global tuning for Fluidsynth:

              From .fweelin.rc:
              <fluidsynth tuning="-31.76"/>

              Adjusts Fluidsynth to -31.76 cents tuning, or 432 Hz

            * Fixed a bug where some non-critical events (such as loading
              or selecting loops) could be missed.

            * Fixed glitch in memory manager that could cause 
              spontaneous exits, usually when erasing loops
        
            * Better clipping of out-of-range MIDI values

            * Removed old 'DelayProcess' code for dealing with real-time
              events. New code uses real-time event manager.

            Tuesday March 13th, 2007
        
            New Features
            ------------

            * Erase-selected-loops command

              Shift+Space now erases all selected loops.
              
            * New ability to tag patch banks

              By tagging patch banks, you can change the way Freewheeling
              responds depending on which patches you have selected. 

              For example, I use Freewheeling with a B3 organ softsynth. 
              My organ patches are arranged in a patch bank. I've tagged that
              patch bank, and configured Freewheeling to respond differently
              when that patch bank is active. So, when I am on an organ patch,
              my faders control the B3 drawbars instead of their usual
              Freewheeling functions.
        
              You can, of course, change any of Freewheeling's behaviors
              depending on the patch bank selected. 
        
              For more info, check the 'SYSTEM_cur_patchbank_tag' variable 
              in the configuration.
              
            * Receive and transmit MIDI channel pressure (aftertouch) messages

            * New 'routethroughpatch' configuration option for MIDI 
              events allows you to send deliberate MIDI messages to the 
              port(s) and channel(s) for the current patch. 
              
              An example configuration is provided that changes the behavior 
              of the modwheel (CC #1). When enabled, the modwheel value is 
              modulated by aftertouch. This allows me to control vibrato 
              (CC #1) on my softsynths with pressure on the keys. 
              The modwheel and pressure values are summed together and 
              sent out as a control change message.

              If I am playing several softsynth channels from my one keyboard,
              the aftertouch then affects all the channels seamlessly.

            * Fixed problem installing configuration files from
              folders with spaces. 
            
2007-01-25  v0.5.5

            New Features
            ------------

            * MIDI sync transmit
 
              - Toggle-able sync transmit on definable output ports

              A friend of mine who is an avid Ableton Live user asked me
              to collaborate with him. I realized that this was a perfect
              opportunity to develop MIDI sync. Freewheeling already
              syncs via the Jack transport, but Ableton and other 
              hardware sequencers are not Jack-aware. 

              As of this version, 
              Freewheeling transmits MIDI sync on definable MIDI
              outs. By default, MIDI clock is sent to the first MIDI
              output. To send MIDI clock, you must first enable it--
              Go to the sync panel (shift+F1) and press shift+F2.
              MIDI Sync Transmit is now enabled (the light glows).

              Now, you can begin playing, and create a pulse. 
              You can either tap the pulse tempo, or you can record a
              loop and use it as the pulse tempo.
 
              Once the pulse begins, Freewheeling starts the external
              sequencer at bar 1. If you deselect the pulse 
              (F6 for free timing), Freewheeling will stop your external
              sequencer. Any pulse you select will begin transmitting
              MIDI sync.

              Freewheeling does not yet receive MIDI sync, so you can't
              yet use Ableton as tempo master.

            * Selecting and working with multiple loops

              You can now toggle (t) and fade (MIDI CC89) volume of
              several loops together. 
  
              You can select loops by right clicking on them, or by
              shift+clicking on them, or by shift+pressing their trigger.
 
              You can select all playing loops by pressing the keypad 
              asterisk. You can select all idle loops with 
              shift+kp asterisk. Ctrl+kp asterisk inverts the current
              selection, and alt+kp asterisk unselects all loops.

              This is the first step towards having multiple scenes
              of loops that you can trigger/fade between.

            * New configuration allows MIDI control of:

              Undo- CC#51
              Patch bank changing by fader- CC #88
              Patch bank changing by buttons- CC #53 / #54
              
            * Continuously variable feedback for overdubs

              You can now change the loop feedback during overdubbing.
              You can realtime vary the amount of the loop that is fed-back
              into itself. The current feedback level is shown on-screen.
            
              By default, MIDI CC#87 controls the loop feedback. 
              The feedback controls are configurable in .fweelin.rc, here:
            
              <!-- Which MIDI controller # controls overdub feedback. -->
              <declare var="VAR_overdubfeedback_midicontrol" type="int" init="87"/>
              <declare var="VAR_overdubfeedback" type="float" init="0.8"/>

            * New configuration allows browsing via MIDI program change
              
              I developed this config for the CME-UF8 master controller, which
              has a rotary encoder that sends MIDI program change messages.
              With the new config, a MIDI program change knob can be used
              to spin through scenes, loops, or softsynth patches.

              Also, controller #50 is configured to act as a shift key for
              faster scrolling through browsers.

            * Save Current Scene (F7) now overwrites an existing scene.
        
            * Save New Scene (shift + F7) forces a new scene to be created.
            
              When overwriting, sequential backups are made 
              with the extensions '.backup.1' '.backup.2' etc. 
              Scene file data is very small. 
              Loops are stored separately, 
              so there is no duplication of unmodified loops.

            * Sync panel can now be toggled with Shift-F1
              Defaults to OFF

            Fixes
            -----

            - Better stability in Event Manager- should fix crashes
        
            - Deliberate MIDI output of events now follows the ports and 
              channels you specify. Incidental echoing of MIDI events follows
              the settings from the current patch.
        
            - Fixed crash on repeat loading of scenes/loading of large scenes

            - No more console-dependent startup questions when a new
              version is installed.
 
            - Library path can now be specified relative to home folder
              (for example, ~/fw-lib)

            - Stream out now shows size in mb, for less frantic update

2006-11-21  v0.5.3

            Many thanks to Danni Coy, who has contributed very significantly to
            this release. Actually, he did most of the work!
                
            New Features
            ------------

            * MAC OS X support

              FreeWheeling is now cross-platform. 
              A universal binary is now available for both Intel & PPC Mac
              platforms. 

            * Multiple Audio Formats
              (Contributed by Danni- Thank You!)

              Save and load loops and live streams in
              OGG, WAVE, AU, and FLAC.

            * OGG encoding quality setting in configuration

            * More flexible MIDI control of external synths.

              - Combination patches allow you to split one MIDI controller
                into a range of zones. This allows you to control several
                different sounds or softsynths from one MIDI control source.
                
                A combipatch defines the zones, as well as the output MIDI 
                port and channel that each zone sends to. You can also send
                MIDI program and bank change messages for each zone, allowing
                you to switch programs on external synths. 

                All of this functionality is integrated into the patch browser,
                so you can seamlessly control other synth apps and 
                sound modules from within FreeWheeling. 
                
                See 'examples/combipatchdemo.xml' for an example 
                configuration.
                
              - Added 'suppressprogramchanges' option for patch banks

                With suppressprogramchanges=1, no MIDI bank and program change
                messages are sent when patches are changed within a patch bank.
                This is useful when you have a softsynth loaded with patches on
                different channels and you merely want to switch channels-
                each patch is mapped to a different channel, but you don't want
                program change messages being sent to mess up your patches. 

                Use this for banks of Linuxsampler channels.
        
              - Added 'separatechannels' option for patch banks

                With separatechannels=0, patches mapped to different channels
                appear in the same patch bank. With this option, you can have a
                collection of several patches on different channels that appear
                together in one list for browsing. This is useful for sampling
                synths where your patches are pre-loaded onto channels.
        
                With separatechannels=1, the old behavior is used. 
                The old behavior splits each channel into a separate bank.
                This works well for DSSI softsynths, where many synths run on
                the same port, but each channel accesses a different synth and
                different set of patches.

            Fixes
            -----
        
            * MIDI thread now runs at high priority FIFO, rather than
              low priority FIFO-- this may improve MIDI performance,
              and hopefully will not affect stability.
        
            * Fixed configuration bug that broke 'CTRL+click' loop renaming.
            
2006-05-17  v0.5.2a

            Bug Fix Release
            ---------------

            * v0.5.2 MIDI port switching was broken.
              (Problem in the configuration .fweelin.rc). 
              The configuration in this release should work.

              No other changes have been made.

2006-05-13  v0.5.2

            The Patch Browser Upgrade
        
            New Features
            ------------
            
            * Integrated patch browsers for external audio apps

            * Bank and program changes are now sent based on the patches
              you define

            * MIDI outputs are now switched as part of the integrated
              patch browser

            * Automatic patch list generation for DSSI softsynths
              
              Detail:
        
              The Fluidsynth patch browser has been expanded to provide
              patch browsing for external synths/apps.
              You can define your patches (MIDI port, channel, bank, program, 
              and name) in external XML patch files.
             
              All your patches, internal and external, now appear in the
              patch browser. The browser now has several pages,
              one for each MIDI port and channel for which you have defined
              patches. Therefore, if you have Hexter on channel 1 of MIDI
              output 1, and WhySynth on channel 2 of MIDI output 1, you can
              independently browse your Hexter and WhySynth patches right from
              within Freewheeling.

              Freewheeling sends the right bank and program changes out the
              right MIDI port based on your patch definitions. It also echoes
              your MIDI events to the right place, so that you can switch
              one keyboard between several softsynths.
        
              When you have the patch browser selected, you can use the
              left/right arrow keys to switch between browser sections.
              This causes your incoming MIDI events to be switched from
              one port to another- as defined in your ~/.fweelin.rc and
              patch XML files. This way, you can quickly 
              switch between softsynths without leaving Freewheeling's 
              interface.

              To use this feature, please read 'examples/readme.txt' for setup
              info.

              I will likely be expanding this to include 'combi' type
              actions where you can custom configure your MIDI signal to be
              sent to several softsynths. Then you could, for example,
              play Hexter with your left hand and Linuxsampler with your
              right hand.

            * Configuration files now live in ~/.fweelin/

              ~/.fweelin.rc will be moved to ~/.fweelin/.fweelin.rc
              when you start version 0.5.2.
              
            Fixes
            -----

            * Fixed startup segfault when running without integrated
              FluidSynth

2006-03-22  v0.5.1
        
            Thank you to all for good ideas and inspiration over the summer
            and winter. Many thanks to Paul Davis for hooking me up with
            a great Linux Audio development gig. And thanks to an anonymous
            donor for his contribution, and to Dubphil and Paul Brossier for 
            beta testing.
        
            ** FreeWheeling now requires libgnutls11-dev (gnutls-openssl)
               instead of openssl (Thanks, Piem).

            New Features
            ------------
        
            * Significantly less memory usage-- more than 20 megabytes less.
              Thanks to Drobilla for pointing out the issue with thread
              stack size.

            * New scripts (see scripts/ folder) to help you manage
              a library of loops. You can now bath move, delete, and 
              archive loops & scenes by date.
               
            * Jack transport sync-      
        
              - Master and slave mode

                For sync to work, you must first create a pulse,
                either by recording a loop and pressing F1, or by tapping
                a pulse by tapping F2 twice.

                Freewheeling tries to become the Jack timebase master,
                but if another app is master, it switches to slave mode.

                In master mode, Freewheeling generates beats and bar counts
                for every repetition of the currently selected pulse.
                In slave mode, Freewheeling receives beats and bar counts
                and syncronizes the currently selected pulse to them.
        
                For both master and slave modes, you can adjust the number of 
                bars/beats per pulse using:
        
                Ctrl/Shift + S - adjust timebase

                You can also switch between sync to bars or sync to beats
                using:

                Alt + S - switch bars/beats sync
          
                Note that in master mode, FW is currently hard-wired to
                generate 4 beats per bar. Since this is preliminary code,
                not a big deal.
        
            * New user interface 

              - Progress bar for saving and loading loops and scenes
        
              - Better organization of help page with clear sections      
            
              - Mouse support
                - Click on loops triggers them. 
                - Space + Click erases loops. 
                - Mousewheel on loops now adjusts loop volumes--
                  very convenient when you are mixing and playing with
                  improvisations.
        
                  These can be configured.
                  See 'loop-clicked' in .fweelin.rc.
                        
              - Joystick support
                - Joystick buttons can now trigger events.
                  For example, I have used FW with a DDR dance mat to 
                  trigger loops. 
        
                  See 'joybutton' in .fweelin.rc.

              - New 'engage' and 'shot' options in trigger-loop.
                'Engage' forces a loop to ON or OFF,
                overriding the default toggle behavior.
                You can use it to create triggers that play short bursts,
                rather than long loops.
                
                'Shot' to be implemented.
        
            * Stability improvements

              - Better thread safety and design improvements to the real-time
                memory manager have improved stability.
        
            * Significant improvements to loop/scene management and browsing
          
              - You can now give loops and scenes your own names
                - New names are stored within the filename of library files
              - Expanded browser window shows several items at once
              - Browser now sorts so that newer loops and scenes are first

            * Better handling of looppoints

              - Resolved issue with clicking at the looppoint on reloaded
                loops.
              - Resolved sporadic clicks on syncronized loops.
              
            * Better handling of loading/saving loops

            * Adjustable video loop delay
            
              - You can now adjust the performance of FreeWheeling
                by changing the delay between video refreshes.
                Several people asked for this feature, because
                FW is processor-heavy on the video side.
         
                The video thread does run at a low priority,
                and so it should not affect the performance of other
                realtime audio threads. However, the system may get
                sluggish, and if this happens, you may want to increase
                the delay in .fweelin.rc:

                <var videodelay="20"/>

            Fixes
            -----

            * Fixed 'glibc double free' segfault- FW should now run
              when compiled with GCC 4.0.
        
            * Adjusted the way F2 tap tempo works-
              tapping a new tempo with F2 is now more responsive,
              but less tolerant of mistakes 
        
            * Fixed 'pure virtual method called' segfault
        
            * Fixed segfault when browsing past end of FluidSynth patch list
        
            * Various fixes to reduce CPU hogging
        
            * Merged patches from Piem's debian package:
              MaxVol, compile fixes for GCC 4.0, and removal of non-free
              elements

            * FW can now run without physical JACK inputs or outputs.
              Thanks to Piem for this patch.

2005-05-02  v0.5pre4

            Many thanks to Sune Mai for several clever fixes,
            to Plutek for your generous donation,
            and to all of you for inspiration and feedback:

            ** FreeWheeling now requires libvorbisfile.
        
            New Features
            ------------

            * Go back to previous improvisations
              - Saving -and- loading of loops and scenes of many loops
              - Integrated browser for scenes, loops, and FluidSynth patches
              - Loops and scenes are sorted by time in browser
        
                QuickStart:
        
                Use F8 to save a loop, F7 to save a scene of all loops,
                F9 to toggle auto-saving of all loops, 'b' to switch browsers
                from FluidSynth to Loops to Scenes, 'enter' to load the
                selected loop or scene, Shift +/- jumps to the next group
                of scenes or loops on disk (at least an hour different in
                time)

                When loading a scene, the loops are restored to their
                original placement. When loading a single loop,
                it goes to the footswitch (SW) by default. You can then
                move it to any QWERTY or MIDI key by pressing that key.
                
                FreeWheeling no longer saves in folders save1, save2, etc. 
                A new library folder (by default, fw-lib/) 
                contains all your loops, scenes, and live mixes.

                A new script scripts/godelete-date, can be used to delete
                loops and scenes from your library by date.
        
            * Full stereo support
              - Individual inputs configurable stereo or mono
              - Automatic stereo or mono loops
              - FluidSynth in stereo or mono

                QuickStart:

                In ~/.fweelin.rc find:
                <var externalaudioinputs="MMS"/>
                This configures two mono and one stereo input.
                FreeWheeling no longer auto-connects to system inputs and
                outputs. You only need to configure what kinds of inputs
                you'd like. Please note that, for now, you need to manually 
                add displays and keyboard mappings for any inputs you add. 
                The rest is handled automatically.
                
            * Multiple ALSA MIDI outputs
              - Send live MIDI messages to different MIDI ports
                to control different Linux apps in real-time

                QuickStart:

                Use "m" key to switch MIDI outputs. The default configuration,
                <var midiouts="2"/>
                defines two MIDI outputs. "m" toggles between the two outputs
                and the internal FluidSynth.
                
            * Configurable limiter
              - Max gain, threshold, and release rate can be changed
              - By default, limiter no longer raises gain above 100%
              
              See help in ~/.fweelin.rc
        
            * Input level displays
              - Peak levels for each input are now shown

            * Footpedal volume adjust configuration

                QuickStart:

                Use MIDI controller 1 to control individual input levels.
                Press keyboard 1-4 to select input. Then move CC1 to adjust
                volume. Or press and hold keyboard 1-4 while moving CC1 to
                jump to a new pedal value without adjusting volume.

                In ~/.fweelin.rc, see:
                <declare var="VAR_footpedal_ctrl_num" type="int" init="1"/>
                <declare var="VAR_footpedal_vol_max" type="float" init="3.0"/>

                You can change the CC# and max volume. 
        
            * Laptop keyboard configuration

                QuickStart:
                
                If you are using FW on a laptop, you probably don't have
                easy access to some keys. I've provided a laptop keyboard
                configuration which remaps some keys. In the help pages, 
                the new keys are shown in square brackets.
                
                To enable this configuration, edit ~/.fweelin.rc:
                <declare var="VAR_laptopkeymode" type="char" init="0"/>
                init="0" becomes init="1"

            * Config file version checking
              - If your config file is out of date, FreeWheeling will
                ask whether you'd like a new one installed.
              
                This means you never have to manually erase ~/.fweelin.rc.
        
            Fixes
            -----
                
            * fixed MIDI note off being misinterpreted on keyboards that
              send note on with velocity 0

            * JACK ports are no longer auto-connected
        
            * fixed startup hang on some systems (mutex init problem)

            * fixed bug in block memory allocator Recycle() 
              that causes a segfault during bursting of many events
                
            * compile fix error: 'ISO C++ forbids cast to non-reference type
              used as l-value' in RTNew()
            
            * footswitch is now controller 64 by default, not 67

            * several keys have been remapped- see the help for details
        
2005-03-11  v0.5pre3
        
            New Features
            ------------

            * A new way to tap downbeat and tempo (tap-pulse event)

            * Switching of metronome sound for pulses (switch-metronome event)
        
            * FreeWheeling events can now trigger MIDI events, so you can
              control other audio apps from within FluidSynth-- 
              For example, you can fire off changes to your modular synths
              from your keyboard or footpedals.
              This eliminates the need for an extra MIDI router app, since
              it is now built in to FreeWheeling. Your custom FreeWheeling
              setup defines how MIDI events are generated.

            * More flexible, clearer configuration syntax, with better error
              checking and colored warning messages.

            * Full input & output implementation of MIDI program change 
              and pitch bend messages.

            * An example of the new MIDI output features- 
              A MIDI patch changer has been configured using the left/right
              arrow keys. An on screen display shows patch number.
              See .fweelin.rc and video tutorial: Hookups.
        
            * Faster, tighter memory management for events.
        
            * Scripts are now included that load FreeWheeling and Hexter DX7
              softsynth, connect to LADSPA reverb and tube amp sim- see
              scripts/README.

            Fixes
            -----

            * fixed config bug that may cause "PreallocatedType: no instance
              available" errors on startup
            * compile fix on Mandrake GCC 3.4.x - 'parenthesized type-id' error
                            
2005-01-19  v0.5pre2

            New Features
            * Saving and autosaving of loops in OGG format- 
              loops and live mixes are saved in their own folders
            * Real-time toggling of FluidSynth
            * Multipage help
            * Documentation for 'z'/'x' loop octave

            Fixes
            * configure check for SDL_gfx filledPieRGBA vs filledpieRGBA
            * configure now gives websites for dependent libraries
            * added XInitThreads to fix 'Xlib async reply' error
        
2005-01-03  v0.5pre1 - first public prerelease

2003 -2004  v0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 (internal)

            many internal changes--

            * moving from OpenGL to 2-D SDL
            * loop visuals
            * downbeat awareness
            * memory manager
            * event manager 
            * block extended data 
            * configuration system
            * many bugfixes

            These form the foundation of FreeWheeling as a modular looping 
            platform.

2002-06-05  FreeWheeling (then 'dogon listening device')

            * initial Linux version based on Mac MAX/MSP prototype
